I think its a very interesting example of how a networked audience behaves differently than an non-networked audience.<\/em><\/p>\\n<p>The mention of the increasing intelligence of a networked audience is what really struck me about the 95 theses at <a href=\\\"http:\/\/cluetrain.com\/\\\">cluetrain.com<\/a>. Mass calloboration, a way to deliberately request help from an audience is talked about in more detail in James Surowiecki&#8217;s <a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.randomhouse.com\/features\/wisdomofcrowds\/\\\">Wisdom of the Crowds<\/a> and emerging intelligence from networked audiences in Howard Rheingold&#8217;s <a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.smartmobs.com\/\\\">Smart Mobs<\/a>. The premise in the 95 theses is that once the early free flowing social media sites got started we were permanently on the path to more networked audiences. And that the networked audiences behaved differently and according to cluetrain, more \\u2018intelligently\\u2019 than the former broadcast centered audiences. This is very appealing, but is it true? I decided to do a series of posts trying to understand this in depth.<\/p>\\n<p>So is this a networked audience more intelligent? It\\u2019s not hard to get consensus that it is definitely different. The problem with intelligence is there are so many definitions. At our last workshop I cited the <a href=\\\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6n8k3v\\\">google doc<\/a> which listed the injured and dead from the recent Mumbai tragedy. This appeared on my twitter feed while the terrorist attack was still ongoing. While I don\\u2019t know for certain who was responsible for the list, it seemed to be created by netizens not journalists nor government officials. Before we go on I want to acknowledge the 2 big objections usually rise to this sort of unofficial information:<br \/>\\n1. Is it accurate? Probably not 100%.<br \/>\\n2. Is this how such sensitive information should be disseminated? I am not sure there is a good answer to that. It probably is different for each family member and the entire answer might turn on whether it is accurate.<\/p>\\n<p>My point in talking about the list is that it is unarguably a different type of audience behavior during a terrorist attack than we are accustomed to seeing. As to intelligence, the information which was sent sped through the network very quickly and was believed. So to the extent the networked vetted it for authenticity which is the intelligence process we seek out from the official news media, this could be perceived as a type of intelligence.<\/p>\\n<p>The list was disseminated around the world within hours, then was apparently reported on by one of the biggest news agencies on the planet as a source of highly relevant information. (I have heard a report that this list and twitter was referenced by the BBC during the early reporting (unconfirmed). ) I would argue it was the most personally relevant information during the attack which is why is flew through twitter.<\/p>\\n<p>So regardless of whether the list should be posted, I think no one can question, that the posting and dissemination of a victim list during a terrorist attack is a significantly different behavior made possible and largely due to the fact that the audience is networked.<\/p>\\n<p>I trusted the Mumbai list to be authentic and mostly accurate even though I only received it from a single source and only heard mention of the BBC reference only much later. And while I had only heard about it from one source, I had reason to believe it was being tweeted by many twitterers.<\/p>\\n<p>One reason for the trust that I gave the list is that the community through which it flowed is preestablished and highly active. I received the link from <a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.shashi.name\/\\\">Shashi (Social Media Swami)<\/a> at Network Solutions and he is a very active twitterer. I know he must have believed and probably received it from sources which he has heard from before. So length of time can be offset by trust in the community before this event and how well the audience members value their reputation. The social technology and community itself can affect how well one values the reputation. Twitterers value a large following and usually their goal is to achieve it. They can loose that following very quickly, because it is easy to start unfollowing someone. Of course if it is highly valuable to them to disseminate the message, then it is more likely they will risk reputation.<\/p>\\n<p>The message also plays a role in whether it is likely to be believed. The more detailed a message is and the more ways it allows verification, the more authentic it sounds. The Mumbai list quickly reached over 200 names, so it seemed to be authentic and verifiable. Also we hope that someone who would attempt to release false information about such an emotionally charged subject, would not be a part of our community.<\/p>\\n<p>There was a presumably false piece of information which flowed through twitter at the same time as the victim list. Apparently a college student in Boston originated a message asking people to stop twittering about Mumbai while the attack was still going on and claimed to be part of the Indian police or government. It is likely that this person thought they would be doing good by disseminating this message. Initially probably a lot of people accepted this statement to be coming from the Indian government, but it was within hours reported on Twitter as being inauthentic.<\/p>\\n<p>It would hard to imagine much value in disseminating the Mumbai list and it would be a very high risk to reputations if it was false. It traveled through a network which can punish false messages quickly but it is highly emotionally relevant would also make it go through the network quickly as well. It also provided ways to verify itself eventually, though not immediately. These seem to be the elements which helped it to be accepted as true.<\/p>\\n<p>So elements which would made this message seem more authentic are:<br \/>\\n1. Pre-established Community<br \/>\\n2. Valuing of reputations.<br \/>\\n3. Flowing through the community through multiple pathways.<br \/>\\n4. Detailed information which could be verified later.<\/p>\\n<p>Elements which made it more likely that a message would go quickly and not be carefully verified<br \/>\\n1. Timeliness on the importance of delivering the message.<br \/>\\n2. Highly emotionally relevant.<\/p>\\n<p>So do these combined components make the audience more intelligent by trusting it to be a lie detector?<br \/>\\nOf course lie detection is not the only type of intelligence we want to see in a crowdsourced or collaborative activity. We want original ideas which solve real problems or at least original ways to send information in a more relevant fashion (i.e. better marketing).<\/p>\\n<p>By the Surowiecki analysis, it seems this kind of event comes up short in a number of ways.

The premise in the 95 theses is that once the early free flowing social media sites got started we were permanently on the path to more networked audiences. And that the networked audiences behaved differently and according to cluetrain, more \u2018intelligently\u2019 than the former broadcast centered audiences. This is very appealing, but is it true? I decided to do a series of posts trying to understand this in depth.<\/p>\n<p>So is this a networked audience more intelligent? It\u2019s not hard to get consensus that it is definitely different. The problem with intelligence is there are so many definitions. At our last workshop I cited the <a href=\"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6n8k3v\">google doc<\/a> which listed the injured and dead from the recent Mumbai tragedy.

So these normally problematic influences in crowdsourcing actually heightened the communities interest in verification in the list and is probably why the impersonator of the Indian government was investigated and quickly found out.

Are both of those the same as the interaction of users with that technology?<\/p>\\n<p>I looked at the <a href=\\\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_media\\\">wikipedia entry for social media<\/a> and it seems to mix these three items (technology,content and interaction). It says:<\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cSocial Media are primarily Internet- and mobile-based <strong>tools <\/strong>for sharing and discussing information among human beings. The term most often refers to <strong>activities that integrate technology, telecommunications and social interaction<\/strong>, and the construction of words, pictures, videos and audio. This interaction, and the manner in which information is presented, depends on the varied perspectives and &#8220;building&#8221; of shared meaning among communities, as people share their stories and experiences. Businesses also refer to social media as <strong>user-generated content<\/strong> (UGC) or consumer-generated media (CGM).\\u201d<br \/>\\nThen later it gives examples of &#8220;social media applications.&#8221;<\/p>\\n<p>So based on this, social media is <strong>a tool<\/strong> used by consumers to create content, <strong>an activity<\/strong> that integrates technology and social interaction AND it is <strong>the content <\/strong>generated by the interaction.<\/p>\\n<p>I feel it can&#8217;t be all three and that this should be clarified to help people understand the evolution of the internet and the new technologies and software. Also it would be useful to distinction those of us who create technology solutions vs those of us who create user interaction strategies for organizations.<\/p>\\n<p>I think we should start using the term social technology as:<\/p>\\n<p>1. Technology which makes use of input and behavior of the users of the technology to enhance its relevance, usability, content, navigation or function. Often this refers to tools which are used in web 2.0 or social media efforts.<\/p>\\n<p>Of course where does that leave the definition of social media? When people talk about social media they seem to be referring to the general methods to display user generated content. For instance &#8220;Blogs are social media.&#8221; But a blog is a general method to publish and invoke discussion. It is not a specific technology. Let&#8217;s do a quick thought experiment to illustrate this. We can imagine a large classroom blackboard being used as the host for a blog whose audience is only meant to be those in the class. An article could be published, comments put up, tags manually updated, and even a separate board if you like to match tags to content. Any blogger would recognize this as an internal blog. We also now have video blogs which users very different technology than text based. Let&#8217;s also imagine a pure video blog which uses no text and its tags and searches are audio based.<\/p>\\n<p>A text blog, a pure video blog and our blackboard blog share the same methodology to solicit feedback from a community but do not share common technology. So a blog is really a social media method, not a specific piece of technology.<\/p>\\n<p>Social media seems to be a collection of methodologies for sharing and discussing information as well as navigating and searching for information. This raises another question which is not covered in the current wikipedia article. Should mining of social media data to improve media experiences such as shopping, searching and giving related information? I think the answer is yes even though this is a substantial bifurcation of social media into its seen and unseen elements. Most people do not realize that google uses the behavior of its users to improve its search but I think google results are a form of social media. Here is the test: If you didn&#8217;t have the social input, would you have the results? In google&#8217;s case: No. Not the same results at any rate and these results are the reason it has won out in the search engine competition. So in plainer terms, crowdsourced content or ranking of content would also be social media. (I would argue ranking of content is content btw.)<\/p>\\n<p>Since I first posted this, <a href=\\\"http:\/\/productfour.wordpress.com\/\\\">Deb Lavoy<\/a> challenged me that social media is actually what happens when technology enables collaboration. And conversations are simple collaborations. I think she is right, but still in the vernacular most people still refer to the actual methods as social media. We comprised on a slide which gives both.

So what about the technology? Can we call it social technology?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Is the technology used to post, read, sharecontent, improve navigation and relevance by making use of user behavior and input, the same as the content generated content itself? Are both of those the same as the interaction of users with that technology?<\/p>\n<p>I looked at the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_media\">wikipedia entry for social media<\/a> and it seems to mix these three items (technology,content and interaction). It says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSocial Media are primarily Internet- and mobile-based <strong>tools <\/strong>for sharing and discussing information among human beings. The term most often refers to <strong>activities that integrate technology, telecommunications and social interaction<\/strong>, and the construction of words, pictures, videos and audio. This interaction, and the manner in which information is presented, depends on the varied perspectives and &#8220;building&#8221; of shared meaning among communities, as people share their stories and experiences. Businesses also refer to social media as <strong>user-generated content<\/strong> (UGC) or consumer-generated media (CGM).\u201d<br \/>\nThen later it gives examples of &#8220;social media applications.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So based on this, social media is <strong>a tool<\/strong> used by consumers to create content, <strong>an activity<\/strong> that integrates technology and social interaction AND it is <strong>the content <\/strong>generated by the interaction.<\/p>\n<p>I feel it can&#8217;t be all three and that this should be clarified to help people understand the evolution of the internet and the new technologies and software. Also it would be useful to distinction those of us who create technology solutions vs those of us who create user interaction strategies for organizations.<\/p>\n<p>I think we should start using the term social technology as:<\/p>\n<p>1. Technology which makes use of input and behavior of the users of the technology to enhance its relevance, usability, content, navigation or function. Often this refers to tools which are used in web 2.0 or social media efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Of course where does that leave the definition of social media? When people talk about social media they seem to be referring to the general methods to display user generated content. For instance &#8220;Blogs are social media.&#8221; But a blog is a general method to publish and invoke discussion. It is not a specific technology. Let&#8217;s do a quick thought experiment to illustrate this. We can imagine a large classroom blackboard being used as the host for a blog whose audience is only meant to be those in the class. An article could be published, comments put up, tags manually updated, and even a separate board if you like to match tags to content. Any blogger would recognize this as an internal blog. We also now have video blogs which users very different technology than text based. Let&#8217;s also imagine a pure video blog which uses no text and its tags and searches are audio based.<\/p>\n<p>A text blog, a pure video blog and our blackboard blog share the same methodology to solicit feedback from a community but do not share common technology. So a blog is really a social media method, not a specific piece of technology.<\/p>\n<p>Social media seems to be a collection of methodologies for sharing and discussing information as well as navigating and searching for information. This raises another question which is not covered in the current wikipedia article. Should mining of social media data to improve media experiences such as shopping, searching and giving related information? I think the answer is yes even though this is a substantial bifurcation of social media into its seen and unseen elements. Most people do not realize that google uses the behavior of its users to improve its search but I think google results are a form of social media. Here is the test: If you didn&#8217;t have the social input, would you have the results? In google&#8217;s case: No. Not the same results at any rate and these results are the reason it has won out in the search engine competition. So in plainer terms, crowdsourced content or ranking of content would also be social media. (I would argue ranking of content is content btw.)<\/p>\n<p>Since I first posted this, <a href=\"http:\/\/productfour.wordpress.com\/\">Deb Lavoy<\/a> challenged me that social media is actually what happens when technology enables collaboration. And conversations are simple collaborations. I think she is right, but still in the vernacular most people still refer to the actual methods as social media. We comprised on a slide which gives both. The technology enable collaboration definition seems the most powerful yet the more I think about it.<\/p>\n<p>As for social technology, I really didn&#8217;t just make it up.

is by guest blog contributor Emily Richards.\\u00a0\\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\\n<p>People, regardless of their rank on the corporate totem pole, love the concept of strategy. It gives them a sense of organization, direction, and an understanding of where they are, where they are going and how they are going to get there. When I begin developing a strategy for a client, I feel the same the exhilaration an artist feels when viewing a blank canvas. The project is our oyster we are going to cultivate, perfect and ultimately revel in its beauty. This, in my humble opinion,\\u00a0is the easy part.<\/p>\\n<p>But there is often a disconnect between the desire for strategy development and actual\\u00a0implementation. All too often excellent strategies sit on shelves and collect dust.\\u00a0The strategy&#8217;s\\u00a0potential and impact are lost due to the very people who initially request the strategy. Don&#8217;t join the ranks of those who crave a road map and then fail to pull it out and consult it once they get into the driver&#8217;s seat.<\/p>\\n<p>There are several ways to overcome death by strategy.<\/p>\\n<p>1) Be realistic. The scope of your strategy should be obtainable. If you have short term goals, request a strategy within a reasonable time frame. If you set goals that you can&#8217;t meet, you will be behind before you are out of the gate. Reaching the first several milestones in a strategy make or break buy-in and affect implementation of the rest of the strategy.<\/p>\\n<p>2) Don&#8217;t become overwhelmed. Some of my clients can&#8217;t handle a one page proposal much less a 12 page strategy. Understand how a client, boss, or decision maker best understands a concept. Design your presentation in a way that they will be attentive to and, in return, receptive to approving. If they aren&#8217;t receptive to how you present the material, your strategy won&#8217;t leave the board room projector.<\/p>\\n<p>3) Keep perspective. Once a strategy is approved, map out a game plan. If you try to tackle every step in the strategy at one time, you will most likely experience an epic fail. Plan out your timeline and take one step at a time.<\/p>\\n<p>4) Be flexible. Strategies must be flexible to accommodate the ebbs and flows of market conditions, corporate initiatives, and other unforeseen challenges. Create a strategy that is flexible to accommodate and evolve regardless of what may come your way.<\/p>\\n<p>5) Keep the momentum. This is the most common reason a strategy fails.

It gives them a sense of organization, direction, and an understanding of where they are, where they are going and how they are going to get there. When I begin developing a strategy for a client, I feel the same the exhilaration an artist feels when viewing a blank canvas. The project is our oyster we are going to cultivate, perfect and ultimately revel in its beauty. This, in my humble opinion,\u00a0is the easy part.<\/p>\n<p>But there is often a disconnect between the desire for strategy development and actual\u00a0implementation. All too often excellent strategies sit on shelves and collect dust.\u00a0The strategy&#8217;s\u00a0potential and impact are lost due to the very people who initially request the strategy. Don&#8217;t join the ranks of those who crave a road map and then fail to pull it out and consult it once they get into the driver&#8217;s seat.<\/p>\n<p>There are several ways to overcome death by strategy.<\/p>\n<p>1) Be realistic. The scope of your strategy should be obtainable. If you have short term goals, request a strategy within a reasonable time frame. If you set goals that you can&#8217;t meet, you will be behind before you are out of the gate. Reaching the first several milestones in a strategy make or break buy-in and affect implementation of the rest of the strategy.<\/p>\n<p>2) Don&#8217;t become overwhelmed. Some of my clients can&#8217;t handle a one page proposal much less a 12 page strategy. Understand how a client, boss, or decision maker best understands a concept. Design your presentation in a way that they will be attentive to and, in return, receptive to approving. If they aren&#8217;t receptive to how you present the material, your strategy won&#8217;t leave the board room projector.<\/p>\n<p>3) Keep perspective. Once a strategy is approved, map out a game plan. If you try to tackle every step in the strategy at one time, you will most likely experience an epic fail. Plan out your timeline and take one step at a time.<\/p>\n<p>4) Be flexible. Strategies must be flexible to accommodate the ebbs and flows of market conditions, corporate initiatives, and other unforeseen challenges. Create a strategy that is flexible to accommodate and evolve regardless of what may come your way.<\/p>\n<p>5) Keep the momentum. This is the most common reason a strategy fails. Time, effort, and energy are put into creating a strategy. \u00a0The concept is presented, and then it is placed on a shelf and forgotten. When developing the strategy, determine a game plan for execution to keep the momentum once it is finalized.<\/p>\n<p>Effective strategies help maintain a proactive approach, eliminate unnecessary stress, and diminish last minute fire drills, which ultimately will make your job, and life, more enjoyable.<\/p>\n<p><em>Emily Richards is\u00a0President of <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.drewconsulting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Drew Consulting, LLC<\/em><\/a><em>, which\u00a0provides comprehensive strategic and tactical marketing solutions that encompass demographic targeting, market research, feasibility studies, competitive market strategy development, and environment analyses.

Seek Out Public Speaking Opportunities:<\/strong> Actively look for opportunities to speak on panels and participate in seminars, workshops and presentations.\\u00a0 This type of platform allows you to express your industry expertise while adding credibility to your business.\\u00a0 You can look for openings to showcase your business through public speaking in many networking groups including your local <a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.chamberofcommerce.com\/chambers\/\\\">Chambers of Commerce<\/a>.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>4. Start Writing:<\/strong> Writing a blog or articles places you in the conversation.\\u00a0 Even better, you increasingly become viewed as an expert.\\u00a0 What business owner doesn\\u2019t want advice from a field expert?<\/p>\\n<p>Bylined articles are articles written for the print media (usually at the invitation of the editor) about your area of expertise. Opportunities can range from a 250-word squib to a 2,000-word feature. A short paragraph at the end of the article usually recaps the author&#8217;s credentials, explains his\/her company or organization title and affiliation, and provides the reader with website contact information.\\u00a0 If you can score an opportunity like this, take it.\\u00a0 If you can\\u2019t, start by blogging.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>5. Protect your Reputation:<\/strong> Don\\u2019t under-estimate word of mouth (or WOM).\\u00a0 Good customer service goes a long way.\\u00a0 Stay top-of-mind with clients, prospects and colleagues by remembering that givers gain.\\u00a0 Reputation is a powerful marketing tool.\\u00a0 Good intentions, follow-through, and delivery are all imperative.\\u00a0 If you provide great service, you can ask your customers to help you enhance the reputation of your business.<\/p>\\n<p>For example, <a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.angieslist.com\/AngiesList\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">Angie&#8217;s List <\/a>has become one of the most popular sites on the web for customer reviews and recommendations of local service businesses in 150 cities nationwide. You can&#8217;t review or even list your own business there, but you can get yourself on their radar, correct inaccuracies, AND ask customers who belong to Angie&#8217;s List to recommend your business on the site. Angie&#8217;s CompanyConnect section has information for small business owners about how the site works.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>What about bad PR? <\/strong><\/p>\\n<p>Some people believe all PR is good PR\\u2026.as long as they spell your name right.\\u00a0 I tend to disagree and do believe that bad PR can be detrimental to your business, if even for a short time. Of course you want to stay top-of-mind, but being top-of-mind with a potential customer will do no good if the overpowering feeling associated with your business is negative.<\/p>\\n<p>Buying decisions are powered by feelings.\\u00a0 If the prospect has bad feelings about your company, the decision will not work in your favor.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Indeed, bad news travels much faster than good news.\\u00a0 If your client has a great experience, they are likely to tell zero to one person.\\u00a0 If your customer has a bad experience, he or she is sure to broadcast their distaste to ten people or more\\u2026.And then there\\u2019s the internet which compounds this process infinitely.<\/p>\\n<p>Still, if you manage your \\u201cbad PR\\u201d properly, you can come out of the situation on top.<\/p>\\n<p>Freedom of speech on the web is important.\\u00a0 Not everyone is going to like everything about you or your company.\\u00a0 Maybe it\\u2019s honest feedback, and you really should listen.\\u00a0 Maybe the harmful comment shows a lack of perspective.\\u00a0 In these instances, so-called \\u201cbad PR\\u201d can help you grow.<\/p>\\n<p>Use the feedback to create a favorable impression by addressing the concern and offering additional resources.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Even \\u201cbad PR\\u201d can create a great opportunity if attended to appropriately.\\u00a0 Look how <a href=\\\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/law\/2011\/04\/20\/the-lawsuits-in-the-past-but-taco-bell-is-still-on-the-offensive\/\\\">Taco Bell<\/a> has spun their \\u201cit\\u2019s not meat\\u201d situation.<\/p>\\n<p><em>Image courtesy of Flickr user jking89.<\/em><\/p>\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/atigronew-staging.coydhea2-liquidwebsites.com\/grotips\/2011\/05\/01\/5-ways-to-promote-your-business-for-free\/free-sign\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-836\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-836\" title=\"Free sign\" src=\"https:\/\/atigronew-staging.coydhea2-liquidwebsites.com\/grotips\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/04\/Free-sign.jpg\" alt=\"Free sign\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a>Favorable PR is always helpful to the bottom line of a small business.\u00a0\u00a0 There are many paths leading to business exposure that come with a price tag, but many people don\u2019t know about all the ways you can gain exposure with little or no monetary investment.\u00a0\u00a0 Here are five you should try:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.

A short paragraph at the end of the article usually recaps the author&#8217;s credentials, explains his\/her company or organization title and affiliation, and provides the reader with website contact information.\u00a0 If you can score an opportunity like this, take it.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t, start by blogging.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Protect your Reputation:<\/strong> Don\u2019t under-estimate word of mouth (or WOM).\u00a0 Good customer service goes a long way.\u00a0 Stay top-of-mind with clients, prospects and colleagues by remembering that givers gain.\u00a0 Reputation is a powerful marketing tool.\u00a0 Good intentions, follow-through, and delivery are all imperative.\u00a0 If you provide great service, you can ask your customers to help you enhance the reputation of your business.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.angieslist.com\/AngiesList\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Angie&#8217;s List <\/a>has become one of the most popular sites on the web for customer reviews and recommendations of local service businesses in 150 cities nationwide. You can&#8217;t review or even list your own business there, but you can get yourself on their radar, correct inaccuracies, AND ask customers who belong to Angie&#8217;s List to recommend your business on the site. Angie&#8217;s CompanyConnect section has information for small business owners about how the site works.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What about bad PR? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some people believe all PR is good PR\u2026.as long as they spell your name right.\u00a0 I tend to disagree and do believe that bad PR can be detrimental to your business, if even for a short time. Of course you want to stay top-of-mind, but being top-of-mind with a potential customer will do no good if the overpowering feeling associated with your business is negative.<\/p>\n<p>Buying decisions are powered by feelings.\u00a0 If the prospect has bad feelings about your company, the decision will not work in your favor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, bad news travels much faster than good news.\u00a0 If your client has a great experience, they are likely to tell zero to one person.\u00a0 If your customer has a bad experience, he or she is sure to broadcast their distaste to ten people or more\u2026.And then there\u2019s the internet which compounds this process infinitely.<\/p>\n<p>Still, if you manage your \u201cbad PR\u201d properly, you can come out of the situation on top.<\/p>\n<p>Freedom of speech on the web is important.\u00a0 Not everyone is going to like everything about you or your company.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s honest feedback, and you really should listen.\u00a0 Maybe the harmful comment shows a lack of perspective.\u00a0 In these instances, so-called \u201cbad PR\u201d can help you grow.<\/p>\n<p>Use the feedback to create a favorable impression by addressing the concern and offering additional resources.\u00a0\u00a0 Even \u201cbad PR\u201d can create a great opportunity if attended to appropriately.\u00a0 Look how <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/law\/2011\/04\/20\/the-lawsuits-in-the-past-but-taco-bell-is-still-on-the-offensive\/\">Taco Bell<\/a> has spun their \u201cit\u2019s not meat\u201d situation.<\/p>\n<p><em>Image courtesy of Flickr user jking89.<\/em><\/p>\n","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sun, 01 May 2011 07:00:27 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 12:47:06 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"","published_by":1},{"id":5853,"title":"Website Content 101: 9 Tips for Writing Great Website Content","slug":"website-content-101-9-tips-for-writing-great-website-content","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<div class=\\\"zemanta-img\\\" style=\\\"margin: 1em; display: block;\\\">\\n<div style=\\\"width: 310px\\\" class=\\\"wp-caption alignright\\\"><a href=\\\"http:\/\/commons.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Medieval_writing_desk.jpg\\\"><img title=\\\"Medieval illustration of a Christian scribe wr...\\\" src=\\\"https:\/\/atigronew-staging.coydhea2-liquidwebsites.com\/grotips\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/300px-Medieval_writing_desk1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Medieval illustration of a Christian scribe wr...\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"299\\\" \/><\/a><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Image via Wikipedia<\/p><\/div>\\n<\/div>\\n<p>Writing website content for your first website\\u2014or fifth version of your website\\u2014is really hard.\\u00a0 Even though you know your business better than anyone else, taking an objective look at it, pinpointing everything your customers and potential customers care about, and then writing it all down is a ginormous challenge.<\/p>\\n<p>And don\\u2019t think that because I\\u2019m a\\u00a0copywriter means I\\u2019m immune to the difficulty of writing one\\u2019s own website!\\u00a0 Experience has proven that it\\u2019s a million times easier for me to write website content for other people than for myself.<\/p>\\n<p>Here are\\u00a09 tips for writing great website content, in no specific order:<\/p>\\n<p><strong>1.

Michael is always enthusiastic and thought-provoking, and in this talk, he summarized takeaways from 5 of the top Web 2.0 thought leaders.\\u00a0 He also provided a set of simple guidelines for leaders to use to move their organizations toward utilizing the transformational potential of Web 2.0 (<span style=\\\"color: #2277dd;\\\">download slides here) <\/span>.<\/p>\\n<p>First though, in order to talk about organizational strategy, he provided a simple way to define that strategy:<\/p>\\n<blockquote><p>Strategy is language that does work.<\/p><\/blockquote>\\n<p>He a defined organizational strategy as aligning tactical actions over time, which move the organization toward a goal.<\/p>\\n<p>There were a lot of keen observations in the talk and on the slides, but these are the core guidelines, which Michael calls design patterns, to follow:<\/p>\\n<div>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Our job is to make YOU succeed<\/strong> &#8211; It used to be that great organizations did great things. \\u00a0 Now great organizations help customers, members, vendors and the public do great things.<\/li>\\n<li><strong>On ramps and loading docks<\/strong> &#8211; Moving ideas and information between people quickly is the key to a modern organization.\\u00a0 Accept deeply that most of the smart people in your field work for someone else, and leverage that fact rather than fight it.<\/li>\\n<\/ul>\\n<\/div>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Edge to core<\/strong> &#8211; Identify the successful innovators at the edge of your organization or audience, and free them up to continue innovating by moving successful innovations into the core processes of the organization.<\/li>\\n<li><strong>Be self aware about change<\/strong> &#8211; Organizations have immune systems and metabolisms \\u2014 be self-aware about change and how your organization deals with change so that positive change is not slowed or stopped because of bureaucratic turf wars between the old and new ways of accomplishing your mission.<\/li>\\n<li><strong>Focus on your mission<\/strong> &#8211; Do not pursue or support innovation for its own sake.

Sales managers tend to be vocal when talking about underperformance, but they don\\u2019t always reflect on their own contribution to their team\\u2019s shortcomings. \\u00a0 As a manager, you have the power to influence your team\\u2019s performance through compensation, and tools and practices. \\u00a0The team\\u2019s success or failure ultimately is your responsibility. \\u00a0 In my work with sales teams, I\\u2019ve discovered some secrets to managing motivation.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>1. Reward and punish the appropriate behaviors with your commission structure.<\/strong><\/p>\\n<p>When I started my sales career, I worked for a midsize telecom company. The company provided comfortable base salaries and a horrible sales commission structure.

Now this is an extreme example, but I&#8217;ve found many companies compensation structures to ineffectually motivate. \\u00a0If you lack control over your team\\u2019s payment structure, you must at least be able to identify and terminate freeloaders.<\/p>\\n<p>Compensation manifests in many forms and must be designed to incentivize salespeople. Make sure the structure serves to reward desired behaviors and punish undesired ones. Promote an energetic environment by instituting contests and games which create healthy competition. Here&#8217;s an example: \\u00a0Choose a company you would love to land as a client but have been unsuccessful at engaging and offer a reward of $100 cash to the first rep to hold a meeting with one of their C-level executives. Compensation includes even the very littlest of things. \\u00a0 Make it a point to compliment your salespeople in front of customers, colleagues and fellow team members. \\u00a0Sales executives crave recognition, so public pats on the back can go a long way.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>2. Offer productive feedback.<\/strong><\/p>\\n<p>Managers can have a wacky way of rationalizing their style. I once had a manager who criticized harshly, yelled frequently and never offered praise. I learned he rationalized this approach by assuming it would keep me tough. \\u00a0Even in his words he was &#8220;testing&#8221; me. While that approach may have worked for the wrestlers he coached, it is generally ineffective in motivating sales professionals.<\/p>\\n<p>Great sales managers know when to stay out of the way, and how to be helpful when needed. Bad sales managers seem to have a talent for the opposite, interfering when things are going well and running for the hills as soon as their own contribution can be measured.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>3. Provide your team with effective sales tools.<\/strong><\/p>\\n<p>I was working with a foreign airline experiencing revenue production issues stemming from an unsuccessful sales team. The team targeted primarily wealthy, high-level business executives. When I asked for a sample of their current brochure, I received a flimsy, discolored trifold with crowded language and numerous misspellings. A piece like this undermines the value of the represented company and contributes to the demise of the sale. A marketing piece must assist a company\\u2019s sales process by acting as a persuasive device that speaks directly to its target market. I have encountered many companies claiming to work with high-end clients while distributing materials that look, well, less than high-end. If your marketing materials don\\u2019t support your pitch, how can low sales possibly surprise you?<\/p>\\n<p>Having the right tools is critical in the selling process for high-yielding teams, and marketing materials are but one example. Another important tool is your Client Relationship Manager (CRM). A well-administered CRM is indispensable for sales forecasting and allows your sales professionals to keep track of prospect information and tasks required to move the sale forward.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>4. Train with a road map, not just by shadowing.<\/strong><\/p>\\n<p>Shadowing is a great training method, but only when combined with a more formal, standardized process. One larger company I\\u2019ve worked with deals in commercial and government contracts. It attributes its casual style in training and management to its entrepreneurial company culture and the rejection of all things bureaucratic. New hires are typically on board weeks after they are needed and are thrown into the fire immediately. Now, the company has hundreds of new hires all representing the company with different sales pitches. If you stop any one of the sales executives hired in the past year, you will get different, incomplete and usually inaccurate answers with regards to the company history, capabilities and practice areas.<\/p>\\n<p>In the above scenario, the sales hires are expected to hit goals but are provided no road map. Every person is &#8220;reinventing the wheel&#8221; with his or her personal technique. There is no brand consistency, company-wide service expectation or proficient method of sharing information.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>5.

The page is hard or impossible to read or the navigation doesn&#8217;t work well. Because of this, we&#8217;ve been advising clients to switch to responsive or mobile-friendly websites.

Companies were creating sites for mobile devices and the .mobi domain came onto the scene as an option to have a separate website just for mobile users. This turned out to be costly and confusing\\u2014and now that approach is completely outdated. What you need now is a single website that has the same or almost the same content but formats it differently depending on the device the viewer is using at the time. That&#8217;s what a responsive or mobile-friendly site does.<\/p>\\n<p>And don&#8217;t let anyone convince you of a quick-fix mobile-friendly solution. Some marketers have been telling clients that all a site needs to be mobile friendly is larger text or code that redirects users to a mobile webpage. They&#8217;re wrong.<\/p>\\n<h3>How Can I Tell if My Website is Responsive?<\/h3>\\n<p>Take a look at this simple video that shows you how to use your desktop browser to test your website to see if it&#8217;s responsive.<\/p>\\n<h3>Even Better, Make It Retina Ready<\/h3>\\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of mobile friendliness, you should also look into converting to a retina ready responsive website. Doing so ensures that people see high-resolution images when they view your site on a high- or retina-resolution device. Not switching to a retina-ready site might make it look blurry on advanced devices.<\/p>\\n<h3>How Do I Convert My Site to Responsive?<\/h3>\\n<p>A traditional website shows the same graphics and HTML to the browser regardless of screen size or resolution. A retina ready responsive site serves code or script to the browser, and that changes the layout the browser shows.<\/p>\\n<p>Because the code or script to do this has to be carefully tested across many devices and is dependent on the right version and type of code used, it&#8217;s not a simple thing to migrate the web content over. In a content management system (CMS) like WordPress, you can change the theme pretty easily, but often this doesn&#8217;t automatically make all of the adjustments you need.<\/p>\\n<p>And it takes time. We find it takes a developer about 15 to 30 hours of work to migrate a typical site to a mobile-friendly site with a similar theme\\u2014and sometimes it takes longer, depending on the number features or plugins and customizations made. Usually you won&#8217;t end up with exactly the same look you had, but the new look is almost unanimously agreed to be better.<\/p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, there isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all answer for this, but all in all, it&#8217;s worth the time and trouble to make sure your site doesn&#8217;t get overlooked on those vast technological plains.

YES! YES! Social signals alert Google as well as other search engines to the amount of traffic and qualified visitors from a social network back to a website\/blog and vice versa. This traffic and &#8220;signaling&#8221; shows Google a more diverse audience as well as multiple forms of effective marketing efforts for the brand and company. When it comes down to it, Google wants to make sure that they are sending the right people to the right websites. A brand with little to no social media presence is less likely to rank higher for a particular string of words or a single keyword than a brand or company that is active. Let&#8217;s say for example you wanted to rank your website for the keywords &#8220;social media services&#8221; in Washington, DC. If your competitors and you both had &#8220;good quality&#8221; content relating to &#8220;social media services&#8221;, but you also had a significant amount of traffic from social media to these targeted pages, Google would know that more people from more places (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) visited your website.<\/p>\\n<p><img class=\\\"aligncenter wp-image-5829\\\" src=\\\"/content/images/wordpress\/2016\/04\/social-signals.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"social signals\\\" width=\\\"608\\\" height=\\\"336\\\" \/><\/p>\\n<h2>Link Building and Social Media<\/h2>\\n<p>Link building has always been a primary factor and effective strategy for SEO.

In a way, social media can allow you to index your blog \/ website&#8217;s content more effectively and to a more targeted audience.

These are merely the tip of the digital iceberg, and only represent a fraction of the capabilities of such systems. <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Drupal CMS, along with its top-rated competitors, add the additional functionality of web content management systems (WCMS).

There is zero opportunity for independent users to offer their perspective and opinions on how to evolve the code.)<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Drupal CMS is open source, and this has allowed the software to grow and gain market share at an impressive rate. It went from the dorm room of its creator, Dries Buytaert, to its ubiquitous status in the CMS world in 15 short years.

In addition, closed source maintains coding that cannot be influenced by the outside world \\u2014 hacking and other illegality not withstanding \\u2014 and is safer for end users. Finally, opponents make it clear: why allow a community of unknowns to fix problems and improve a formula, when closed source employs the best of the best?<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Atigro has seen great success within closed and open environments, and we know the positives presented by Drupal CMS and similar systems.

There is zero opportunity for independent users to offer their perspective and opinions on how to evolve the code.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drupal CMS is open source, and this has allowed the software to grow and gain market share at an impressive rate. It went from the dorm room of its creator, Dries Buytaert, to its ubiquitous status in the CMS world in 15 short years. Considering a visit to the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/whitehouse.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White House<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?

Drupal is neither an \u201calso-ran\u201d or \u201cup-and-comer\u201d \u2014 it is firmly established and gaining influence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a mixed bag of opinions in regards to OSS. In the positive column, it is free; developed by the people; collaborative and gives businesses the assurance that problems will be solved by a community of users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Critics of OSS point to the \u201csupposed\u201d positives, and highlight negative aspects of each. Yes, the software is free, which ensures the quality and tools within are lacking and only adequate at best. In addition, closed source maintains coding that cannot be influenced by the outside world \u2014 hacking and other illegality not withstanding \u2014 and is safer for end users. Finally, opponents make it clear: why allow a community of unknowns to fix problems and improve a formula, when closed source employs the best of the best?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atigro has seen great success within closed and open environments, and we know the positives presented by Drupal CMS and similar systems. When used by knowledgeable professionals, they are safe, offer creative freedom and provide entry points to novices and experts alike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;\">Is Drupal CMS Right for My Business?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drupal CMS is not the choice for everyone.

First-timers select a WCMS and quickly learn that open source is not the same as easy.

The rapid growth in this framework has given birth to effective ways of developing web services with a lot of uniqueness. In this post, we are going to look at the features available in this framework that has made it a darling to many web developers worldwide.<\/p>\\n<h2>It Adheres Completely to MVC Pattern<\/h2>\\n<p>As we all know, MVC pattern is crucial in web design. It helps save data and consolidates several queries into a compound database. In addition, MVC patterns allow the user to update, remove or read a given model class. Because a large scale web application needs to distinguish the logic from the display in a subtle and smart way, they require a framework that is compatible with MVC. It is its compatibility with the MVC model that makes the platform a better choice for large scale applications.<\/p>\\n<h2>It Does Not Need Any Configuration<\/h2>\\n<p>The framework does not have intricate XML files. This means that it is simpler to use during the initial stages when developing a website. There is no configuration needed. You only need to formulate the database and proceed with developing the web application or the website you want. This way, you can save a lot of precious time you could have used in configuring the software.<\/p>\\n<h2>CakePHP\\u00a0Supports Many Languages<\/h2>\\n<p>As a web developer, you want to come up with something that will be relevant to a wide range of people across the world. Language is often a limiting factor when it comes to usability of a web application. Luckily, the framework allows us to use more than one language when developing. It is compatible with many languages across the world hence there is no language barrier that might hinder a developer from working on a web application.<\/p>\\n<h2>It is Fully Compatible With\\u00a0Object Rotational Mapping Technique (ORM)<\/h2>\\n<p>We have ORM techniques such as Hibernate for Java, SQLAlchemy for Pythons and DBLx:: Class for Perl. Luckily, CakePHP is fully compatible with all the techniques. The software stores the data in the form of tables and is capable of showcasing them as classes. Therefore, it is able to define the relationships between different tables using the classes. Also, the framework can easily predefine all the validation and callback definitions in the large scale web application.<\/p>\\n<h2>CakePHP \\u00a0Reduces Coding<\/h2>\\n<p>Coding is time-consuming and tiresome. Finding a software or any other solution that reduces the need for coding is the best thing that a developer wants. With the framework&#8217;s inbuilt coding libraries, the coding work for the developer reduces significantly. This way, you can come up with an application within a short time compared to when you have to write each code by yourself.<\/p>\\n<h2>It is Secure<\/h2>\\n<p>This PHP framework has several tools you can use for input validation and protecting your forms from interference and tampering. Other tools available help protect from XSS, CSRF and SQL attacks. It is also a good web building tool licensed under the MIT license codes.<\/p>\\n<h2>It is Free and Flexible to license<\/h2>\\n<p>Just like any other PHP framework, CakePHP is popular because it is free and flexible when licensing. It is also easy to install and use, making it a better option for developers who deal with complex web applications used for commercial purposes.<\/p>\\n<h2>It Allows for The Creation of Test Cases<\/h2>\\n<p>Large scale web applications require a lot of test cases to work properly. CakePHP development provides you with a platform to create your own tests and customize the available ones. You can also check the critical points of the tests to ensure they are effective. This software comes in handy when you want to test the quality based on functionality and performance of a given application.<\/p>\\n<p>In case you are planning to build an application that could go viral, use CakePHP development for good outcome. The features discussed above will help you come up with the best application. If you are still hesitant, you are missing out a lot.

Many businesses are starting to use it for its simplicity, power, and efficiency.<\/p>\\n<h2>Why Should Businesses Use Microsoft Sharepoint?<\/h2>\\n<p>For once, it is a web platform, which means anyone with an Internet browser can use it. It is optimized to work with all common browsers. Even though it is a Microsoft product, it is compatible with Apple browsers and devices. The software has been thoroughly quality tested, and is bug and glitch free.<\/p>\\n<p>The biggest reason to use Microsoft Sharepoint, however, is that it is very versatile. You can use it develop any kind of website with any number of people. It can even be used for projects other than websites. The program is particularly good for building apps, and can even do CRMs (although there may be better CRM builders out there).<\/p>\\n<h2>Using Microsoft Sharepoint With Other Microsoft Projects<\/h2>\\n<p>One of the best things about the program is the integration with other Microsoft products. This is vital as the Microsoft Office suite is still the standard office software for the majority of companies. If the employees are familiar with Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, they will be able to use Sharepoint. The program integrates with the Office suite so well that multiple people can work on the same document at the same time, then publish it as a web page accessible to mobile devices instantly.<\/p>\\n<p>Sharepoint development made sure to include compatibility with Microsoft&#8217;s hit program OneDrive for Business as well. This program allows companies to give each of their employees an individual cloud storage account, while the company controls who has access to each account and also pays a discounted group rate.<\/p>\\n<p>In addition to the specific benefits of OneDrive, there are the benefits of cloud storage in general. Now, businesses don&#8217;t need to worry about losing vital data, including web development data, if there is a crash. OneDrive also has very strong security measures, so data stored there is safe. It&#8217;s clear to see why this program was important in the Sharepoint development process.<\/p>\\n<h2>Reservations About the Program<\/h2>\\n<p>While many people are pleased with the Sharepoint development tools, some users have had issues with the product. It certainly is powerful, but it can also have a steep learning curve. Also, while it is very compatible with Microsoft products, it often does not work well with programs from other companies. Finally, while some less advanced users found the Microsoft program to be above their computer abilities, some very advanced users were disappointed by the lack of advanced features.<\/p>\\n<h2>Sharepoint&#8217;s Learning Curve<\/h2>\\n<p>The platform was designed to be easy to use, but it was only partially successful on this front. Sharing documents is one feature that is easy for everyone to use. However, all of the more advanced features can be confusing to some. It is important for business owners to consider the computer literacy of all their employees. A 22 year old IT person probably will be able to handle it, but a 60 year old accountant might have some trouble.<\/p>\\n<h2>The Problem of Compatibility<\/h2>\\n<p>Microsoft likes to talk about their software&#8217;s integration with Office and OneDrive, and this truly is a feature. However, Sharepoint&#8217;s compatibility with non-Microsoft programs is a serious issue. For example, people who are not using Internet Explorer often have problems undertaking simple tasks such as opening or sharing a document. A significant minority of professionals in this day and age use other browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

This framework is older than Laravel, but has the advantage of being able to support earlier versions of PHP.<\/p>\\n<p>CodeIgniter&#8217;s age has given it quite the history and made it popular among coders. Many use this framework for small and large projects. It&#8217;s known to be the best documented framework out there. Its documentation is well structured, clear and simple, especially for the most commonly accessed components of the framework. Besides that, it&#8217;s easy for developers to use.<\/p>\\n<p>A developer doesn&#8217;t have to be a master in Model\\u2013view\\u2013controller (MVC) architecture to master CodeIgniter development. Novice developers without a high level of experience and coding knowledge will find it especially handy and easy to use. The framework is even easy to set up. All the user has to do is download their preferred version and unzip the files.<\/p>\\n<p>The popularity of this PHP framework has also helped prove its stability. It has been tested by hundreds of thousands of coders on all levels and has proven itself to be one of the most stable frameworks out there. Besides that, because of the large community of users, any instability that is found is quickly corrected. So, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to find an unstable component in the a1 version of the framework.

Someone who is developing modern apps and pages will find Laravel to be the best choice.

The a1 version also offers greater stability by implementing well organized unit tests.<\/p>\n<p>Other big advantages of this PHP framework are:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A built-in templating engine: The mustache-like templating language makes the engine easy to use, and learning the language is easy for developers at all levels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Output caching: Output caching reduces web page loading time by allowing pages to be cached. This is handy for improving website performance and efficiency.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>CodeIgniter has many great features, but the truth of the matter is that it&#8217;s considered an obsolete framework. The extension of code files is needed to even make CodeIgniter development work. It also doesn&#8217;t offer default modular separation, which is a major disadvantage.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>In the battle of Laravel vs CodeIgniter, there are obvious arguments for the use of either. Someone who is developing modern apps and pages will find Laravel to be the best choice. On the other hand, those who work in older environments will find CodeIgniter to be both a comfortable and easy choice. However, the choice of which one is better to use comes down to individual needs of a developer.<\/p>\n","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":3,"created_at":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 13:28:11 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 12:42:09 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"","published_by":1},{"id":24887,"title":"Our Atigro Partner Program page is up.

The traffic coming from SEO is organic, that is free. Traffic from PPC on the other hand isn\\u2019t free, as it\\u2019s made clear in the name (Pay Per Click). <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">But both practices are variations of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), a key tool used for Internet Marketing campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2>Actual Differences between SEO and PPC<\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When you run a search through Google, you\\u2019ll sometimes find search results that are highlighted as advertised results. These advertised results are commonly found either at the bottom or top of the search results list and are born of an arrangement with Google to promote the advertised sites on the front-page of search lists in exchange for payment (Pay Per Click). <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">On the other hand, organic search results are those sites listed naturally on a search page without any indication of being an advert. These are sites who have earned their place on the search result sheet through hard earned points gained by<\/span><a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.citywideseo.com\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> optimizing their SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. They might not have paid for their spot on the search result in cash, but they surely earned it with sweat, tears and craft.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The position of a Pay Per Click ad on a search page depends on &#8211; the targeted keywords, the number of said keywords in the ad copy, the number of keywords on the landing page, and other factors. But they\\u2019re usually positioned at the top or below the organic results. This just goes to show that even if paid for, a certain degree of SEO still needs to be done on a site for it to be optimally represented on a search result.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Simply put, if you choose to apply an SEO tactic, you can get top page positions on search results if your website is search engine optimized. But if you\\u2019re running a PPC campaign, your ad gets on the first page by paying a higher cost per click.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><b>Do you need your site to appear on the first page of a search result? And what will it cost you?<\/b><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">I did mention earlier that SEO is a free way to get traffic, that is, from a cash standpoint, unlike PPC which is paid for in cash. While this is true, it also raises my other point, which is, it takes loads of effort to get top SERP ranking and free traffic via SEO.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Competition is always tight for keywords, especially popular ones. A professionally built website operating the perfect SEO plan sounds like a great recipe for gaining the top 5 positioning on search engine results. \\u201cBut that\\u2019s easier said than done, unless there\\u2019s a specialist handling it on your behalf\\u201d,<\/span> <span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><br \/>\\n<\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">CityWideSeo.com<\/span><a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.infintechdesigns.com\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Regardless of what some SEO themed blogs or workshops might have preached to you, if you are not familiar with the inner workings of how search engines work, you\\u2019re better off getting an expert to either train you or do the actual work for you.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">But<\/span><a href=\\\"http:\/\/www.infintechdesigns.com\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> true and trusted SEO experts <\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">aren\\u2019t necessarily cheap.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">On the other hand, the cost for a Pay Per Click service depends on a host of factors. For example, the cost per click of advertising on Google Adwords will be calculated by considering popularity of the chosen keywords, the number of advertisers interested in that particular keyword, and other elements.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">But there is a silver lining when it comes to PPC, and that is, you pay for only the clicks your ad receives. <\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Which actually drives more traffic to a site? SEO or PPC?<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Overall, organic traffic through SEO is usually overwhelmingly more than PPC\\u2019s traffic. Which means, if you manage to tweak your website to perfection and optimize your keywords, you\\u2019ll actually get more traffic in the long run than with paying for those keywords through PPC.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This is because when you are organically ranked on search engines\\u2019 top positions (the majority of internet users only click on the first five search results), it\\u2019s expected that your top ranked site will enjoy a continuous flow of traffic without having to pay Google for it.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Organic traffic is continuous as long as you are ranking in one of the top positions.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Simply put, organic traffic provides better and longer lasting results for your site in both quantity and quality. <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Also, if you were to gain the same amount of traffic via PPC, that would translate to a bigger cost because you\\u2019d have to pay your Pay Per Click provider for every one of those clicks on your ad. Picture it this way; if your PPC campaign is hugely successful and you get a million clicks, you\\u2019d have to pay for those million clicks. And pay you will, because trust me, you don\\u2019t want to owe <\/span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">a Don<\/span><\/i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> like Google.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">But if you tried going <\/span><i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">the SEO way<\/span><\/i><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> and couldn\\u2019t reach your targeted audience, then you really have no choice but to indulge in PPC to achieve your goals. <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><b>Conversion<\/b><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Conversion is when a site\\u2019s visitors become paying customers or loyal visitors. <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When ads are highly optimized and targeted, they are more likely to convert a visitor through PPC than through an organic search.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Why?<\/span><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If your web page is ranked because of multiple keywords and good SEO, an online searcher might visit your site, but not because he\/she has found what they\\u2019re looking for. <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">With a successful PPC campaign, you get your ad clicked on by visitors who are totally interested and have invested in your content because your ad has shown them that they\\u2019ve found precisely what they\\u2019re searching for.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The truth is, using either SEO or PPC comes at a unique price.

The traffic coming from SEO is organic, that is free. Traffic from PPC on the other hand isn\u2019t free, as it\u2019s made clear in the name (Pay Per Click). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But both practices are variations of Search Engine Marketing (SEM), a key tool used for Internet Marketing campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Actual Differences between SEO and PPC<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you run a search through Google, you\u2019ll sometimes find search results that are highlighted as advertised results. These advertised results are commonly found either at the bottom or top of the search results list and are born of an arrangement with Google to promote the advertised sites on the front-page of search lists in exchange for payment (Pay Per Click). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, organic search results are those sites listed naturally on a search page without any indication of being an advert. These are sites who have earned their place on the search result sheet through hard earned points gained by<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.citywideseo.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> optimizing their SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They might not have paid for their spot on the search result in cash, but they surely earned it with sweat, tears and craft.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The position of a Pay Per Click ad on a search page depends on &#8211; the targeted keywords, the number of said keywords in the ad copy, the number of keywords on the landing page, and other factors. But they\u2019re usually positioned at the top or below the organic results. This just goes to show that even if paid for, a certain degree of SEO still needs to be done on a site for it to be optimally represented on a search result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, if you choose to apply an SEO tactic, you can get top page positions on search results if your website is search engine optimized. But if you\u2019re running a PPC campaign, your ad gets on the first page by paying a higher cost per click.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Do you need your site to appear on the first page of a search result? And what will it cost you?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did mention earlier that SEO is a free way to get traffic, that is, from a cash standpoint, unlike PPC which is paid for in cash. While this is true, it also raises my other point, which is, it takes loads of effort to get top SERP ranking and free traffic via SEO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competition is always tight for keywords, especially popular ones. A professionally built website operating the perfect SEO plan sounds like a great recipe for gaining the top 5 positioning on search engine results. \u201cBut that\u2019s easier said than done, unless there\u2019s a specialist handling it on your behalf\u201d,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CityWideSeo.com<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.infintechdesigns.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of what some SEO themed blogs or workshops might have preached to you, if you are not familiar with the inner workings of how search engines work, you\u2019re better off getting an expert to either train you or do the actual work for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.infintechdesigns.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> true and trusted SEO experts <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aren\u2019t necessarily cheap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, the cost for a Pay Per Click service depends on a host of factors. For example, the cost per click of advertising on Google Adwords will be calculated by considering popularity of the chosen keywords, the number of advertisers interested in that particular keyword, and other elements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is a silver lining when it comes to PPC, and that is, you pay for only the clicks your ad receives. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Which actually drives more traffic to a site? SEO or PPC?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, organic traffic through SEO is usually overwhelmingly more than PPC\u2019s traffic. Which means, if you manage to tweak your website to perfection and optimize your keywords, you\u2019ll actually get more traffic in the long run than with paying for those keywords through PPC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is because when you are organically ranked on search engines\u2019 top positions (the majority of internet users only click on the first five search results), it\u2019s expected that your top ranked site will enjoy a continuous flow of traffic without having to pay Google for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organic traffic is continuous as long as you are ranking in one of the top positions.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, organic traffic provides better and longer lasting results for your site in both quantity and quality. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, if you were to gain the same amount of traffic via PPC, that would translate to a bigger cost because you\u2019d have to pay your Pay Per Click provider for every one of those clicks on your ad. Picture it this way; if your PPC campaign is hugely successful and you get a million clicks, you\u2019d have to pay for those million clicks. And pay you will, because trust me, you don\u2019t want to owe <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a Don<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if you tried going <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the SEO way<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and couldn\u2019t reach your targeted audience, then you really have no choice but to indulge in PPC to achieve your goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Conversion<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversion is when a site\u2019s visitors become paying customers or loyal visitors. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When ads are highly optimized and targeted, they are more likely to convert a visitor through PPC than through an organic search.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your web page is ranked because of multiple keywords and good SEO, an online searcher might visit your site, but not because he\/she has found what they\u2019re looking for. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a successful PPC campaign, you get your ad clicked on by visitors who are totally interested and have invested in your content because your ad has shown them that they\u2019ve found precisely what they\u2019re searching for.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is, using either SEO or PPC comes at a unique price. And the said price can be a high one especially if you don\u2019t possess the requisite knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting the best out of SEO takes time and maximum effort.

few weeks ago <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/local-seo\/local-search-ranking-signals\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Search Engine Journal compiled a list of Top 25 Local Search Ranking Signals<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">. In case you missed the article or don\\u2019t have time to read and take note of all 25 Ranking Signals, we went ahead and selected ten that we feel you should know about.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Claim Your Google My Business (GMB) Profile<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Your first step to optimizing for local SEO should be to claim your Google My Business profile, so <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">if you have not claimed it<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, you should do it as soon as possible. It is free and relatively effortless.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Once you do claim it, you will need to set some basic business information, namely your business\\u2019s name, address, phone number, hours you are open, and if you have a website, provide a link to your website. You will also want to set your primary and secondary categories to describe what your business is about, as well as enter in a business description.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If you are a local business that relies on generating business in your area, it is essential to claim this profile. On desktop and mobile searches with some kind of discernable buyer intent, these profiles are triggered and featured immediately underneath the ads and above the organic search results, so chances are good this will be the second thing searchers will see when they go looking for goods and services near them.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Add Photos to Your Google My Business Profile<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">After you claim your GMB profile, strongly consider adding photos to it. <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/business\/answer\/6335804\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">According to Google<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, \\u201cbusinesses with photos receive 42% more requests for driving directions to their location from users on Google, and 35% more clicks through to their websites than businesses that don&#8217;t have photos.\\u201d Photos add an element of legitimacy to a business, are featured in the profiles when searchers view them, let potential customers see any products or services you offer, and so on. <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">At a minimum, add your business\\u2019s logo, set a cover photo, and snap a quick photo of the outside of your business. If you can provide more than that, do so.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Claim Your Bing Places for Business Profile<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Bing has a similar service to Google and Bing Places for Business functions as that search engine\\u2019s Google My Business. The <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.bingplaces.com\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">profile is free to claim<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> and there is no reason not to do it.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Create or Claim Online Directories and Citations<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In the interest of definitions, a local \\u201ccitation\\u201d is an online reference of your business and directories typically contain aggregates of these. Citations typically contain the name, address, and phone number (NAP), as well as the website and other details.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Effectively, citations and directories send online signals to humans and search engines that your business is a real-world entity. They also function as backlinks. Lastly, they come in a variety of forms, ranging from pure directories (like Yellowpages) to social media websites (like Yelp and Facebook). <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">You should make sure to create or claim a handful of at least the major ones, especially those that are free, as well as any site that is important in your niche (for example, every attorney should be Avvo). You should also make sure that you use the exact same name, address, and phone number everywhere this appears (it is also one of our featured points below).<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Sample directories and citations include:<\/span><\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><a href=\\\"https:\/\/mapsconnect.apple.com\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Apple Maps<\/span><\/a><\/li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.yellowpages.com\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Yellowpages<\/span><\/a><\/li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><a href=\\\"https:\/\/foursquare.com\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Foursquare<\/span><\/a><\/li>\\n<li style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><a href=\\\"https:\/\/smallbusiness.yahoo.com\/local\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Yahoo&#8217;s Localworks<\/span><\/a><\/li>\\n<\/ul>\\n<h2><b>Create or Claim Review Site Listings<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Reviews are incredibly important to local businesses since they provide real-world feedback to searchers and help searchers get an idea if they should consider purchasing that business\\u2019s goods or services. You should also claim your listings on the major websites, especially considering many of them are free to claim.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The four websites you should immediately prioritize claiming are <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Facebook<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Yelp<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.bbb.org\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">BBB<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, and <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Glassdoor<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> (this last one is more for hiring, but anyone with buyer intent is going to be influenced by low-review scores from employees if they happen to see those).<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Create Social Media Profiles<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Having a social media presence is one of the backbones to digital marketing, so chances are you likely have at least a Facebook page for your business. If you don\\u2019t have one or you don\\u2019t have profiles on the top social media sites (Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, Youtube), you should claim these and do basic optimizations to the profiles\/pages (add a logo, fill out business details and hours if possible, add a link to the site, and so on).<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If you don\\u2019t plan on actively using the channel, make sure to leave a note\/post\/tweet or contact information to tell them where you can be found and contacted. Most people expect a quick response from businesses on social media when they reach out, so doing something like this will go a long way to ensuring they don\\u2019t become frustrated or mad when they make a contact and don\\u2019t receive a response.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Make Sure Your Name, Address, and Phone Number (NAP) is Consistent Online<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">NAP stands for name, address, and phone number. You want this to be consistently the same everywhere it appears online, both for people and for search engines. <\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">On the human side of things, you want to make sure it is crystal clear where your business is located and that your phone number is accurate. Doing so makes sure someone does not waste time trying to find something that isn\\u2019t there and minimizes frustrations if they need to call and can\\u2019t reach you.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">On the search engine side, Google and Bing want to make sure they are providing the correct information. Additionally, it helps reinforce the signals that your business is a real-world entity.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Add Structured Data Markup (Schema) to Your Site for Local Business Details<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To briefly describe what structured data is, it is code for websites that help search engines better understand the meaning and relationships underlying the text and elements that appear on websites. Described a different way, it helps search engines understand things on websites in a similar way to how we can look at or read something and \\u201cknow\\u201d what it means. Additionally, structured data assists search engines with adding more advanced features in search results &#8211; if you have ever seen images, review starts, or event listings in the search results, these are made possible through structured data markup on the websites with this content. Lastly, the best practices version of structured data is Schema.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">At a minimum, you should <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/schema.org\/LocalBusiness\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">mark up your website with LocalBusiness Schema<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, which will assist Google and Bing in connecting the dots between your business\\u2019s NAP and business hours information listed on the website and everywhere else on the web.<\/span><\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">For more information about structured data, consider looking at <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/custom-search\/docs\/structured_data\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Google\\u2019s reference information on structured data and the best practices to implement it<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, the <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/schema.org\/\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Schema website<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">, and Google\\u2019s section on <\/span><a href=\\\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/data-types\/local-business\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">local business structured data<\/span><\/a><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Make Sure Your Site is Mobile Responsive<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Chances are very good that if someone is looking for information about a local business, they are making the search on their phone. There is also a good chance that they are out-and-about when they make that search as well and likely ready to make a purchasing decision. In any event, this is your first chance to make a good first impression, so it is incredibly important to make sure your site is mobile responsive and displays well on their phone.<\/span><\/p>\\n<h2><b>Make Sure Your Content is Localized<\/b><\/h2>\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Lastly, make sure that content on your site is localized for your area. Depending on your brand and what makes sense for it, consider creating content about events and things going on in the local community or relating topics back to how it affects the local area.<\/span><\/p>\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few weeks ago <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/local-seo\/local-search-ranking-signals\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search Engine Journal compiled a list of Top 25 Local Search Ranking Signals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

There is also a good chance that they are out-and-about when they make that search as well and likely ready to make a purchasing decision.

to something we could use to explain to new members who we are and why we matter to them. Our recruitment is up and easier as well as interested in our events by the people we want to attend. Both the design and messaging has taken us up a level as an organization and boosted confidence in our membership and the communities we serve.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; David Schulman, President,

The company delivered enormous value to its clients but was poorly differentiated in a crowded market. It needed to succinctly explain how it was significantly better than competitors.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong>: We began by interviewing clients and subject-matter experts. These insights pointed to key differences that make them unique. From there, we distinctively positioned them using terms their clients valued and continue to support their ongoing SEO, content strategy, and sales collateral.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>Impact<\/strong>: \\u201cNow, we have better conversations with our clients. Prospects recognize when it\\u2019s time to talk to us and partners know when to initiate discussions.

The company delivered enormous value to its clients but was poorly differentiated in a crowded market. It needed to succinctly explain how it was significantly better than competitors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong>: We began by interviewing clients and subject-matter experts. These insights pointed to key differences that make them unique. From there, we distinctively positioned them using terms their clients valued and continue to support their ongoing SEO, content strategy, and sales collateral.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Impact<\/strong>: \u201cNow, we have better conversations with our clients. Prospects recognize when it\u2019s time to talk to us and partners know when to initiate discussions. This investment has taken the friction out of our sales process for us to own a distinct market position.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Michael Thompson, VP Sales &amp; Strategy, Sky Data

I learned a lot about tools that can help me connect with my audience. I also appreciate that Atigro comunicates to me in layperson&#8217;s terms unlike many web experts.

to their main offerings. Its user experience had fallen behind similar pubs and a layer of technical issues made it more tedious to publish than necessary.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>Solution<\/strong>: We studied the best contenders in the publishing realm, and redesigned the new user experience to stand with the best of them. We built them an effective and sustainable SEO strategy. We took over maintenance and support of the site as a whole, improving performance and reliability.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>Impact<\/strong>: \\u201cAtigro helped us reimagine our web presence and how we use technology to improve our visibility, reach and security. Their SEO strategy was spot on. We launched topic hubs that attract readers and improve discoverability when health policy was undergoing a dramatic change.

No call length limit and 50 users due to Covid-19.

No call length limit and 50 users due to Covid-19.

Employees whose compensation exceeds $100,000 are only included in payroll costs up to the first $100,000.<\/li>\n<li>Health care benefits payments for insurance premiums and retirement benefits.<\/li>\n<li>State and local taxes assessed on employee compensation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Independent Contractors Apply Separately<\/h2>\n<p>The new rules state that <strong>payroll costs do not include independent contractors.

style=\\\"font-size: 18pt;\\\">Details on SBA Issues Interim Final Rules on April 2, 2020<\/h2>\\n<p>On April 2, 2020, the SBA issued new rules on the implementation of Paycheck Protection Program loans, which permits the SBA to guaranteed 100% of 7(a) loans with no personal guarantees or collateral required, under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (or CARES Act).<\/p>\\n<p>Here are some details that may impact your decision to apply for a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan.<\/p>\\n<h2 style=\\\"font-size: 18pt;\\\">Loan Qualifications<\/h2>\\n<p>PPP loans are available for small businesses, 501(c)(3) nonprofits, and tax-exempt veterans organizations with 500 or fewer employees.<\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You must certify you were in operation on February 15, 2020 and had employees for whom you paid salaries and payroll taxes to.<\/li>\\n<li><strong>Individuals who operated under a sole proprietorship, as an independent contractor, or a self-employed individual are also eligible.<\/strong><\/li>\\n<li>Funds are to be used to retain workers and maintain payroll, make mortgage or lease payments, and make utility payments.<\/li>\\n<\/ul>\\n<p>Exclusions precluding a business from applying for a PPP loan:<\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Applicant has an owner with 20%+ of equity who is incarcerated, on probation, on parole; presently subject to an indictment, criminal information, arraignment, or other means by which formal criminal charges are brought in any jurisdiction; or has been convicted of a felony within 5 years.<\/li>\\n<li>Business or owners have obtained a direct or guaranteed loan from the SBA or any other federal agency that is currently delinquent or has defaulted within 7 years.<\/li>\\n<\/ul>\\n<h2 style=\\\"font-size: 18pt;\\\">Loan Amount<\/h2>\\n<p>Your PPP loan amount may be for a<strong> maximum of 2.5 times monthly payroll costs<\/strong> \\u2013 the average for the 12 months preceding the loan and less than $10M.<\/p>\\n<p>Payroll costs include:<\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Compensation payments for salary, wages, or commissions; vacation, family, medical or sick leave and dismissal or separation allowance. Employees whose compensation exceeds $100,000 are only included in payroll costs up to the first $100,000.<\/li>\\n<li>Health care benefits payments for insurance premiums and retirement benefits.<\/li>\\n<li>State and local taxes assessed on employee compensation.<\/li>\\n<\/ul>\\n<h2 style=\\\"font-size: 18pt;\\\">Independent Contractors Apply Separately<\/h2>\\n<p>The new rules state that <strong>payroll costs do not include independent contractors. Independent contractors can apply a PPP loan.<\/strong> Requiring independent contractors to apply for a PPP loan is likely to increase the number of applications and slow down approvals.<\/p>\\n<h2 style=\\\"font-size: 18pt;\\\">First Come, First Served Basis \\u2013 APPLY NOW<\/h2>\\n<p>PPP loans will be approved on a first come, first served basis. It means you need to<strong> apply soon before applications exceed total lending limits of $349B.<\/strong> There may be more demand than funds available. The last day to apply for and receive a loan is June 30, 2020.<\/p>\\n<h2 style=\\\"font-size: 18pt;\\\">Loan Term and Interest Rate<\/h2>\\n<p>The new SBA rules state that the <strong>PPP loan term shall be 2 years and deferral of payment is for a maximum of 6 months with an interest rate of 1%.<\/strong> You will not have to make any payments for 6 months following loan disbursement, however, interest will accrue during these 6 months.<\/p>\\n<h2 style=\\\"font-size: 18pt;\\\">Loan Forgiveness Eligibility<\/h2>\\n<p>You may not be responsible for loan repayment if all the funds are used for forgivable purposes.
