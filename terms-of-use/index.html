You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the this website Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.</p>
<p><em>Analytics information:</em></p>

<p><em>Cookies and Browser Thumbprinting information:</em></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets this website help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time.

You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. Browser thumbprinting is also used in a similar way and for similar purposes as cookies.</p>

If you click from an email or enter information on a form, your name may be connected to your activity for internal marketing uses.</p>
<p><em>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</em></p>
<p>When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.  Personalized URLs, browser thumbprints and cookies may also be used in the emails to track an individual’s activity on our website but not on websites we do not own or operate.</p>

<p>When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by this website. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>

<p><strong>Target Ads and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Atigro utilizes a middleware technology solution that sits between the advertiser, and the ads server-Demand Side Platforms. Our role is to facilitate the matching, onboarding, and optimization of audiences.</p>
<p>Atigro utilizes compiled household and business data to facilitate the matching process. It is derived from publicly available sources and adheres to online and offline privacy recommendations and regulations of the DMA, IAB, Trustwave, GLB Act regulations, as well as HIPAA recommendations. We are certified for compliance with HITRUST in our management of sensitive data and physical security as well as Trustwave for online data management.</p>
<p>Our practices follow the privacy guidelines detailed in the White House “Privacy Bill of Rights”, the House proposal HR 4081 Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2017 and the FTC Privacy and Security Update of 2018.</p>
<p>At Atigro we take privacy seriously and extend full cooperation with the chosen standard for all consumers to opt-out of the user of their information for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>The Smart Zones IP targeting process converts an organization’s CRM or prospect data on customers to their digital delivery points. There is no use of cookies in our process. Organizations will supply us with names and addresses or website logs through a secure connection to a secure cloud-based server. This is an ISO 27018 standard Safe Haven secure environment that is inaccessible to outsiders and to the organization itself. In the Safe Haven, we match the names and addresses of individuals, or the IP address of website logs, to our internal, household or business data. Through our proprietary matching process, we strip and discard the matched records in the organization’s list in order to maintain the anonymity of a user’s digital ID. The product of the match is posted to a deployment platform such as an ad server or DSP where the depersonalized digital IDs are matched to the platform’s impressions history in order to resolve to the platform’s ID. At no point outside of the Safe Haven can a user’s digital ID be resolved back to a person, household or business.</p>
<p>When an organization provides us with access to the logs of the organization’s website we match the log to the digital ID and append publicly sourced compiled household or business data to that ID. An organization who wishes to identify website visits on their site are required to demonstrate a permissible purpose for use of the names and address. The organization is limited in the use of the data to 1st party lead generation and populating their CRM. Language must be included in the organization’s privacy policy informing the user that their digital information is being collected and that collection much follows all regulatory requirements of the DMA and IAB, including, but not limited to providing the ability for the user to opt-out.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the law in the European Union, a series of regulations have been put into effect that would penalize any party that serves targeted online ads to a European citizen without their consent. There are a number of open questions about the impact and implementation of this regulation regarding the absence of consent, geographic targeting, and device identifiers. In the EU solution s based exclusively on network infrastructure and Internet routing with no personally identifiable IP addresses. A user’s PII can not be tracked or revealed because the system is strictly based on telecommunications assignment has no knowledge of household or personal information.</p>
<p>HIPAA recommendations for the healthcare and insurance industries promote the clustering of households at a minimum level to assure personal and household identifiers be obscured and that they be stripped of PII. The Graham, Leach, Billings Act further requires that banking and financial offers that provide unsolicited offers of credit be generalized to a minimum household clustering that averages household credit scores at a geographic level typical of a zip code plus 4.</p>
<p>Smart Zones IP targeting in the United States supports the matching of a digital ID to the organization’s CRM file or prospect list at a person, household or business level if the organization is in compliance with local regulations. In specific industries where sensitive information may be associated with a digital ID Atigro requires that the organization adapt a clustering methodology at a minimum level to assure that all personally identifiable information is protected. Smart Zones IP target supports this clustering process by providing a 6 digit zip, 5 digit zip or 3 digit zip postal code output option. We have made a version of this geographic clustering technique available for any organization we provide audiences for.</p>
<p>Finally, an individual should always have the option to opt-out of being included in a digitally targeted audience. We require that the organizations, ad servers and demand-side platforms we build audiences also provide a robust capability for opting-out. They must include language in their privacy policy that clearly states that a user may be tracked. They must also provide a means for their users to opt-out. When a user elects to opt-out of receiving advertising from an organization that person is removed from any further contact by the organization.</p>
